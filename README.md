1. Code Structure and Clarity
	•	Use functions for loading data, training, evaluating, and saving the model.
	•	Follow PEP 8 coding style for clarity.

2. Proper Dataset Splitting
	•	Ensure random splitting of training and test data.
	•	Deep Lake’s KMNIST dataset is already split, but verify randomness.

3. README File

Your README.md should include:
	•	Installation steps (pip install deeplake torch torchvision).
	•	Dataset details (Deep Lake KMNIST).
	•	How to train and evaluate the model.
	•	Expected results and accuracy.

4. Short Report

Include:
	•	Observations: Training loss trends, accuracy improvements.
	•	Interpretation: Model performance, overfitting risks.
	•	Future Work: Possible improvements (CNN, hyperparameter tuning).
